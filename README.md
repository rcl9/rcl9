Please visit the [main landing page](https://rcl9.github.io) which has a short visual and textual overview of each repository and why it may be of interest to you.

During the late 1970's and 1980's I was a hard-core, low-level, prolific software and hardware developer, a "[builder of everything](</Where It All Started/Readme.md>)". This GitHub site will strive, amoung other goals, to bring [some of those projects](https://github.com/rcl9/Imagery-of-Past-Projects) back to life in a documented and open source manner. Fortunately I had documented, archived and stored away most of those projects at the time for future historical recollection.

Generally speaking, the documentation will primarily be of interest to Z-80 and CP/M-80 people, along with some other projects relating to digital music + MIDI synthesis machines and peripheral hardware pinned to the 1980s. A focus will also be made to document some machines for future historical reference. 

The following photo albums contain snapshots of some of my more interesting projects from the 1970's to late 1980's that are documented in these GitHub repos:
