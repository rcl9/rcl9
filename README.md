During the late 1970's and 1980's I was a hard-core, low-level, prolific software and hardware developer, a "builder of everything". This GitHub site will strive, amoung other goals, to bring [some of those projects](https://github.com/rcl9/Imagery-of-Past-Projects) back to life in a documented and open source manner. Fortunately I had documented, archived and stored away most of those projects at the time for future historical recollection.

Generally speaking, the documentation will primarily be of interest to Z-80 and CP/M-80 people, along with some other related projects relating to MIDI music machines and peripheral hardware pinned to the 1980s. A focus will also be made to document some machines for future historical reference. 

Some of my 1980's computers related to these projects may include: 

- Exidy Sorcerer, S-100 expansion box & related add-on hardware projects

- [Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC (1984-era)](https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer-1984-by-Motel-Computers---History-and-Documentation)

- [Multiflex Video Display Terminal Board](https://github.com/rcl9/MultiFlex-Z80-H19-Terminal-Emulation-ROMs)

- Semitech Pied Piper

- and others.
