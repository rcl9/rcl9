Welcome to *Rob's 1970's and 1980's Retro Computing Archive*.

During the late 1970's and 1980's I was a hard-core, low-level, prolific software and hardware developer, a "builder of everything". This Github site will strive, amoung other goals, to bring [some of those projects](/Imagery-of-Past-Projects) back to life in a documented and open source manner. Fortunately I had documented, archived and stored away most of those projects at the time for future historical recollection.

In tanden with that prior work, I had a focussed interest with digital music synthesis hardware design from 1979 through to ~1991, during which time I had a goal to design and build my own Fairlight or Synclavier sampling synthesizer (which cost $25k to $200k in 1980's dollars). That is why each of my Z80 computers always included a home-brew MIDI interface and how my final Z80 "MIDI Computer" came to be.

Generally speaking, the documentation will primarily be of interest to Z-80 and CP/M-80 people, along with some other related projects relating to MIDI music machines and peripheral hardware pinned to the 1980s. A focus will also be made to document some machines for future historical reference. 

Some of my 1980's computers related to these projects may include: Exidy Sorcerer I + S-100 expansion box, [Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC](/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer-1984-by-Motel-Computers---History-and-Documentation), [Multiflex Video Display Terminal Board](/MultiFlex-Z80-H19-Terminal-Emulation-ROMs), Semitech Pied Piper and Atari|ST.
